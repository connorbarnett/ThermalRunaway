# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/rails/ThermalRails/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/rails/ThermalRails/db/*.sqlite3
/rails/ThermalRails/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/rails/ThermalRails/log/*.log
/rails/ThermalRails/tmp

rails/ThermalRails/log/*.log
rails/ThermalRails/tmp
